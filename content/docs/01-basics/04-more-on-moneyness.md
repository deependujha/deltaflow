## General Points

### ITM & ATM

- Since, ITM options are already profitable, they have a `higher premium`.
- ATM options have a high chance of becoming ITM later, so they also have a `high premium`.

### OTM

- OTM options have less chance of becoming ITM, so they have a `lower premium`.
- Very far OTM options are often called **worthless** options, as they are unlikely to become ITM before expiry.
- So, their premium is very low.
- Bcoz, of very low premium, new traders often buy them, hoping for a big move. (like lottery tickets)
- Others, buy them to **hedge** their positions.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
  Let's say current NIFTY is at 20,000.

- We sold a CE 20,000 (ATM) for ‚Çπ100. If the price goes very up (say 25,000), we will lose a lot (might also margin call take place).
- So, we buy a CE 23,000 (OTM) for ‚Çπ5. When we start losing on the CE 20,000, we will start making money (or `cutting loses`) on the CE 23,000.

The above described is a classic **bear call spread** (a type of vertical spread) ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **defined-risk strategy** that limits your max loss *and* caps your profit, in exchange for a smaller but safer payout.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Bear Call Spread Setup**

**Spot (NIFTY): 20,000**  
You do two things:

1. **Sell CE 20,000 (ATM)** at ‚Çπ100 ‚Üí You receive ‚Çπ100  
2. **Buy CE 23,000 (OTM)** at ‚Çπ5 ‚Üí You pay ‚Çπ5

---

### üí∞ Net Credit = ‚Çπ95 (Your max profit)**

You collected ‚Çπ100 and paid ‚Çπ5. So you pocket ‚Çπ95 **if NIFTY stays below 20,000**.

---

### ü§Ø Max Loss?

Let‚Äôs assume NIFTY flies to **25,000**.

- Your **sold CE 20,000** is ‚Çπ5,000 in loss (25,000 - 20,000)
- Your **bought CE 23,000** is worth ‚Çπ2,000 (25,000 - 23,000)

So:  
**Net loss = ‚Çπ5,000 - ‚Çπ2,000 = ‚Çπ3,000**  
But since you earned ‚Çπ95 upfront,  
**Final P&L = -‚Çπ2,905** (Max loss)

### üìè Summary Table

| NIFTY at Expiry | 20,000 CE (sold) | 23,000 CE (bought) | Net P&L     |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| < 20,000         | ‚Çπ0 (worthless)    | ‚Çπ0 (worthless)      | +‚Çπ95        |
| 21,000           | -‚Çπ1,000           | ‚Çπ0                  | -‚Çπ905       |
| 22,000           | -‚Çπ2,000           | ‚Çπ0                  | -‚Çπ1,905     |
| 23,000           | -‚Çπ3,000           | ‚Çπ0                  | -‚Çπ2,905     |
| 24,000           | -‚Çπ4,000           | +‚Çπ1,000             | -‚Çπ2,905     |
| 25,000           | -‚Çπ5,000           | +‚Çπ2,000             | -‚Çπ2,905     |

### üîí Why Do This?

- You‚Äôre **bearish or neutral** ‚Äî think market won‚Äôt go above 20k
- Want to earn premium, but **cap your worst-case scenario**
- Margin requirement is lower than naked CE sell  
  (brokers *love* this for risk control)

- üü¢ Left vertical line: ‚Çπ20,000 (Short CE)
- üî¥ Right vertical line: ‚Çπ23,000 (Long CE)
- üîµ Blue curve: Net P&L at expiry

### üßæ Interpretation

- Max profit: ‚Çπ95 (when NIFTY closes below 20,000)
- Max loss: ‚Çπ2,905 (when NIFTY closes at or above 23,000)
- Breakeven point: Around ‚Çπ20,095 (because ‚Çπ20,000 + ‚Çπ95 net credit)
